# Spinner

Spinner is a WIP Social/Game bot designed for Discord's Hack Week.

It was heavily inspired by Reddit's growing group chat april fool's joke.

The original principal behind this april fool's joke is that rooms would be formed with groups of people. If enough people voted, the group would be combined with another. Alternatively, it could be immortalized as a subreddit. Finally, it could be disbanded.

The goal of Spinner is to re-create that and make similar features.

## Usage

You can supply an OAuth bot token in one of two ways:

```
./Spinner <token>
```

or

```
./Spinner --token <token>
```

if you prefer verbosity.

This is subject to change.
